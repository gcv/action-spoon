* Action Spoon — a Hammerspoon Plugin

Action Spoon (or Action.spoon, formerly Backup Spoon) is a [[http://www.hammerspoon.org/][Hammerspoon]] [[https://www.hammerspoon.org/Spoons/][plugin, or Spoon]], for orchestrating command-line utilities to run on a schedule. It was originally designed for backup tools like [[https://restic.net/][restic]], [[https://www.borgbackup.org/][Borg]], and [[https://kopia.io][Kopia]]. With Action Spoon, these utilities can even be configured to run simultaneously to provide extra redundancy, since all have been known to have [[https://forum.restic.net/t/recovery-options-for-damaged-repositories/1571][data-loss]] bugs.


** Installation

- Install your CLI (e.g. backup) utilities.
- Download the latest release zip file from https://github.com/gcv/action-spoon/releases/.
- Open the downloaded file, and Hammerspoon will automatically install it.
- Edit your Hammerspoon configuration file (~~/.hammerspoon/init.lua~), and add the following line:

#+BEGIN_SRC lua
hs.loadSpoon("Action")
#+END_SRC

After editing the configuration file (see below), reload the Hammerspoon configuration.


** Concepts

FIXME

- sets
- actions
- commands
- intervals


** Configuration

Make sure whatever CLI tools you want to use with Action Spoon are correctly configured and work from the command line non-interactively (i.e., without prompting the user for any input).

Add a file to your ~XDG_CONFIG_HOME~ directory (probably ~~./config~) named ~ActionSpoon.lua~. An example configuration file looks like this:

FIXME

#+begin_src lua

#+end_src


** Usage

- Action Spoon displays a menu icon when running.
- Clicking the menu icon shows the list of sets. There should be a status icon next to each.

| status icon | meaning                |
|-------------+------------------------|
| ✓           | set task succeeded     |
| !           | error                  |
| ⟳           | set task in progress   |
| ×           | set task stopped       |
| •           | waiting for set action |

- The menu icon turns grey when disabled.
- The menu icon turns red when an error affects at least one set. When this happens, look for messages on the Hammerspoon console.
- The menu icon turns orange when a task has been interrupted.
- Set timers will be suspended when the system goes into sleep mode.
- After editing the configuration file, reload the Hammerspoon configuration, either from the Hammerspoon console or with a dedicated key binding to ~hs.reload()~.


** Notes

*** Restic: reasonable commands for S3 backups

Set ~RESTIC_PASSWORD_COMMAND~ to something reasonable, e.g., something like this for retrieving the password from the Keychain:

#+begin_src shell
/usr/bin/security find-generic-password -s 'My Restic Backup' -w
#+end_src

Set ~AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID~, ~AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY~, and ~AWS_DEFAULT_REGION~ appropriately.

As an alternative to passing ~--repo~ options to all these commands, consider setting ~RESTIC_REPOSITORY~. (Naturally, this only makes sense if you don't use different repositories.)


**** Initialize

#+begin_src shell
restic \
    --repo=s3:s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/<path> \
    init
#+end_src


**** Backup

#+begin_src shell
restic \
    --repo=s3:s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/<path> \
    --limit-upload=950 \
    --option=s3.storage-class=STANDARD_IA \
    --quiet \
    backup
#+end_src


**** Prune

#+begin_src shell
restic \
    --repo=s3:s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/<path> \
    forget --prune \
    --max-unused=unlimited \
    --keep-last=100 \
    --keep-hourly=72 \
    --keep-daily=60 \
    --keep-weekly=12 \
    --keep-monthly=36 \
    --keep-yearly=100
#+end_src


**** List snapshots

#+begin_src shell
restic \
    --repo=s3:s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/<path> \
    snapshots
#+end_src


**** List files in snapshot

Substitute snapshot ID for ~latest~ below as needed.

#+begin_src shell
restic \
    --repo=s3:s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/<path> \
    ls latest
#+end_src


**** Retrieve files from snapshot

#+begin_src shell
restic \
    --repo=s3:s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/<path> \
    restore latest \
    --include="/<path in snapshot>/*" \
    --target="/<path to restore location>"
#+end_src


*** Kopia: S3 infrequent access policy

Blobs starting with ~p~ can be marked infrequent for savings (https://kopia.discourse.group/t/using-s3-infrequent-access-policies/187/2).
