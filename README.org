* Action Spoon â€” a Hammerspoon Plugin

Action Spoon (or Action.spoon, formerly Backup Spoon) is a [[http://www.hammerspoon.org/][Hammerspoon]] [[https://www.hammerspoon.org/Spoons/][plugin, or Spoon]], for orchestrating command-line utilities to run on a schedule. It was originally designed for backup tools like [[https://restic.net/][restic]], [[https://www.borgbackup.org/][Borg]], and [[https://kopia.io][Kopia]]. With Action Spoon, these utilities can even be configured to run simultaneously to provide extra redundancy, since all have been known to have [[https://forum.restic.net/t/recovery-options-for-damaged-repositories/1571][data-loss]] bugs.
